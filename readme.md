# Dotfiles

This is the collection of my vim, zsh, tmux configurations.
The setup is only for macos

To execute the file, use command "chmod u+x <filename>" 
install.sh is not tested yet.

You should run install/backup.sh to backup your files first.

Thanks to https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles for this configuration, please read the readme in nick repo for more details
